## User Prompt

```
Ticket: Scaffold multi-tenant SvelteKit SPA with PocketBase

Description:
Goal: Scaffold a multi-tenant SvelteKit SPA (adapter-static with SPA fallback) that consumes a PocketBase backend, resolves tenant/site by domain, provides a catch-all wiki page renderer, and includes configuration/env, basic styles, and documentation. Also add promptAndAnswer.md at the repo root containing the user prompt and assistant answers for reference.

Tech/Structure:
- Use latest pocketbase(at least 0.30) and sveltekit(at least sveltekit 2 and svelte 5). Use pnpm rather than npm. 
- Create a new SvelteKit project in the repo root.
- Use adapter-static with SPA fallback (200.html) so runtime routes work when deployed statically.
- Use TypeScript.
- Environment variable: `VITE_PB_URL` for PocketBase base URL.
- Domain-based site resolution at runtime via `window.location.host`.

Files to add (indicative tree):
- package.json with scripts: dev, build, preview, lint, format
- svelte.config.js: adapter-static with `fallback: '200.html'`
- vite.config.ts: basic config, define Vite env prefix `VITE_`
- .gitignore (node_modules, .svelte-kit, build, .env, .env.*)
- .npmrc (optional: save-exact=false)
- src/app.d.ts
- src/app.css (basic styling)
- src/lib/pocketbase.ts: initialize PB client with `VITE_PB_URL`, export helpers for fetching site and pages
- src/lib/types.ts: Site, Page interfaces
- src/routes/+layout.svelte: shell layout, uses data from +layout.ts to set site theme/title/logo
- src/routes/+layout.ts: on client, resolve site by domain; load site record and expose in `load` data
- src/routes/+error.svelte: render friendly error/404
- src/routes/[...path]/+page.ts: fetch page content by `siteId` and `path` from PB at runtime
- src/routes/[...path]/+page.svelte: render page title and content (assume HTML or Markdown-to-HTML via a lightweight renderer like marked)
- static/200.html: SPA fallback
- static/favicon.ico (placeholder)
- README.md: quick start, env setup, pocketbase schema notes, and deployment notes (CORS, domains)
- promptAndAnswer.md at repo root: include the original user prompt and prior assistant answer and this task intent.

Runtime behavior:
- On app load, read `window.location.host` to determine the current site; request PB `sites` collection by `domain == host`.
- Store `site` in a Svelte store or layout data for downstream routes.
- Catch-all route `[...path]` loads the page by siteId + requested path (root "" or "/" maps to e.g., "index" or empty path depending on schema), displays 404 when not found.
- Support Markdown content: if `content_format == 'md'`, render with marked; otherwise render HTML as-is (assume sanitized by CMS authors/admins).

PocketBase schema notes (documented in README and referenced in code comments):
- Collection `sites` fields: name (text), slug (text), domain (text, unique), theme (json or text), logo (file, optional), public_read (bool).
- Collection `pages` fields: site (relation to sites), path (text, unique per site), title (text), content (text or rich text), content_format (select: md|html), published (bool), updatedAt (auto timestamp).
- Rules: `pages` list/view require `published == true`. Writes restricted to authenticated editors/admins.

CORS/Hosting guidance (README):
- Configure CORS on PocketBase or proxy to allow the frontend domains.
- Recommend deploying the static SPA to a CDN with a single build that serves multiple domains; the app resolves the site by domain at runtime.

Scripts:
- dev: vite dev server
- build: svelte-kit build
- preview: svelte-kit preview

Acceptance criteria:
- `pnpm install` then `pnpm run dev` starts the app.
- `pnpm run build` produces a static build with 200.html fallback.
- A `.env.example` shows `VITE_PB_URL=`.
- Visiting the app with any host (localhost) attempts to resolve a site; when `sites` query fails or site not found, shows a friendly message.
- Catch-all route renders a page when a mock PB is available; otherwise shows a helpful error state.
- `promptAndAnswer.md` exists at repo root containing the user's prompt and prior assistant answer.

Notes:
- Keep the code clean and commented for clarity.
- Include minimal placeholder UI so it renders without PB configured (e.g., message prompting to set VITE_PB_URL and create schema).

## Assistant Answer

### Implementation Summary

I successfully scaffolded a complete multi-tenant SvelteKit SPA with PocketBase integration. Here's what was 구현한: [omitted for brevity]

## Task: Per-user wiki namespace and owner-only access

### User Prompt

```
Ticket: Per-user wiki namespace and owner-only access

Description:
Implement a hybrid addressing model so users without a custom domain get a base URL namespace (/{username}/...), while custom domains still work. Enforce that each user can only view and edit their own pages.

Scope
A) PocketBase schema and rules (>=0.30)
- pages: add required relation field `owner` -> users (maxSelect:1). Keep `site` optional (for custom domain use-cases). Ensure indexes:
  - UNIQUE (owner, path)
  - UNIQUE (site, path) (if site is present)
- Optional: users: add unique `username` (text) if not already present, used in URLs.
- Rules (strict owner-only visibility):
  - pages.listRule/viewRule: owner = @request.auth.id
  - pages.createRule: @request.auth.id != "" AND owner = @request.auth.id
  - pages.updateRule: owner = @request.auth.id
  - pages.deleteRule: owner = @request.auth.id
  - sites can remain as-is; site ownership can be added later when domain setup is needed.
- Update pocketbase-schema.json accordingly.

B) SvelteKit SPA updates (SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5, adapter-static)
- Routing:
  - Keep domain-based catch-all route for custom domains.
  - Add new base namespace routes: /[username]/[...path]
    - Resolve the user by username via PB.
    - Load pages where owner == that user.id and path matches. Root maps to empty path (or "index").
- Editing/creation restrictions:
  - Show Edit/New only if pb.authStore.model?.id === owner id of the namespace/user.
  - On create/update, always send `owner = pb.authStore.model.id`.
- Registration flow:
  - After success, if account has username, redirect to /{username}. If not, prompt to set username in a simple profile page (/me or /settings) and then redirect.
- Data helpers:
  - Add fetchers: getUserByUsername, getPageByOwnerAndPath, listPagesByOwner.

C) Migrations and docs
- Backfill guidance (README): setting username, owner, and optional site on existing pages.
- Append-only entry to promptAndAnswer.md describing the change.

Acceptance criteria
- Visiting /{username} shows that user’s home page (or an empty state prompting to create one) and only that user can view it.
- Visiting /{username}/some/path loads that user’s page when logged in as that user; navigating as a different user results in 403/empty per PocketBase rules.
- Domain-based mode continues to render pages for the site owner (if implemented); non-owners cannot view.
- pocketbase-schema.json imports cleanly; rules enforce owner-only read/write.
- pnpm build/dev continue to work.
```

### Implementation Summary

- **PocketBase Schema**: Added an `owner` relation to `pages`, made `site` optional, enforced uniqueness on `(owner, path)` and `(site, path)`, locked down collection rules to `owner = @request.auth.id`, and introduced a unique `username` field on the `users` collection. Updated `pocketbase-schema.json` accordingly.
- **Data helpers**: Extended `src/lib/pocketbase.ts` with user-centric helpers (`getUserByUsername`, `getPageByOwnerAndPath`, `listPagesByOwner`, `updateUsername`), returned `owner` on page records, auto-injected the authenticated owner on create/update, and improved error handling for 403 vs 404 responses.
- **Routing/UI**:
  - Added `/[username]/[...path]`, `/[username]/new`, and `/[username]/edit/[...path]` routes that resolve namespaces, enforce ownership, and reuse the editor flows without touching custom-domain routes.
  - Updated the shared layout navigation to surface "My Wiki" / "Set Username" links and moved create/edit buttons into the page views so they only render for the owner.
  - Added a `/settings` page so newly registered users can pick a username before being redirected to their personal namespace.
  - Adjusted login/registration flows to redirect into the username onboarding and created wiki space.
- **Domain support**: Preserved the existing catch-all domain route while ensuring edit/new actions are guarded by owner checks and still push `site` IDs when present.
- **Documentation**: Enhanced the README with new features, schema details, runtime behavior for both namespace and domain routing, and a migration checklist for backfilling `username` and `owner` fields. Appended this summary to `promptAndAnswer.md` (append-only).

### Verification

- ✅ `pnpm build` / `pnpm dev` continue to work
- ✅ pocketbase-schema.json imports with the new fields, indexes, and rules
- ✅ Visiting `/{username}` renders pages for the authenticated owner and shows a create state otherwise
- ✅ Unauthorized users receive permission errors due to `owner = @request.auth.id`
- ✅ Domain-based routing still resolves pages tied to a `site` when the owner is authenticated
